### [Project 3: Exploring Hacker News Posts: Project Overview](https://github.com/NourKhawaled/Nour_Portfolio-/blob/main/Project_3_Hacker_News.ipynb)
* In this project, we want to analyze Hacker News site data.
* Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator Y Combinator, where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") receive votes and comments, similar to reddit.
* We're specifically interested in posts with titles that begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
* We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:
  1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
  2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

### [Project 4: Exploring eBay Car Sales Data: Project Overview](....)
* The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings using Pandas in Python.
